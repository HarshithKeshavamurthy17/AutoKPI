- **Variability Analysis**: Measures coefficient of variation

**Insights Provided**:
- Distribution shape (normal, skewed)
- Value concentration percentages
- Variability metrics
- Segmentation opportunities

**Example KPIs**:
- "Amount Concentration (80/20 Rule)" - Shows if 20% of records drive 80% of value
- "Revenue Distribution Skewness" - Identifies if revenue is normally distributed
- "Spending Score Variability" - Measures how much values vary

**Visualizations**: 
- Histograms for distributions
- Pareto charts (bar + cumulative line) for concentration

**Actionable Insights**:
- "Focus on the top 20% - they drive most of the value"
- "Consider segmentation for high-variability metrics"

---

### 5. 📉 Trend Analysis KPIs
**What they do**: Detect trend changes and breakpoints over time

**Types**:
- **Trend Breakpoints**: Identifies significant changes between time periods
- **Growth Rate Analysis**: Measures period-over-period changes

**Insights Provided**:
- Trend direction (increasing/decreasing)
- Percentage change between periods
- Statistical significance
- Forecast recommendations

**Example KPIs**:
- "Amount Trend Change" - Shows if revenue increased or decreased over time
- "Revenue Growth Rate" - Measures period-over-period growth

**Visualizations**: Line charts with trend indicators

**Actionable Insights**:
- "Continue positive momentum" or "Investigate decline and take action"
- "Consider forecasting based on trend direction"

**Insight**: "85% of Amount comes from the top 20% of records. This suggests a Pareto distribution."
**Action**: "Focus on the top 20% - they drive most of the value. Consider targeted strategies for high-value segments."

### Example 4: Anomaly Detection
**KPI**: "Anomaly Rate in Amount"
**Insight**: "8% of Amount values are statistical anomalies (3+ standard deviations). Review for data entry errors."
**Action**: "Review outlier values for data entry errors. Consider outlier treatment (removal, winsorization, or separate analysis)."

### Example 5: Trend Change
**KPI**: "Amount Trend Change"
**Insight**: "Amount increased by 15% from the first half ($350) to the second half ($405) of the period."
